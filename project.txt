Project:
Some initial data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time after surgery

People:
Jane is a Data Scientist.
Samit is a Statistician.

We will need to determine who is responsible for what in this project.
We will probably need a programmer.
This person will need to be competent in Python or R. Preferably both. 

The programmer also needs to be familiar with Pandas, matplotlin and ggplot.
